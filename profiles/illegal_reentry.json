Extract entities, events, and relationships from case documents with emphasis on: identity and nationality; immigration history (entries, encounters, removals, deportations, orders of removal, warnings/conditions not to reenter, permission to reenter); criminal history (prior convictions, sentences, custody status); locations (border points, counties, courts, detention facilities); and any alleged gang affiliation or in-custody misconduct that may affect sentencing arguments under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Capture dates precisely for every key event (encounters, arrests, removals, reentries, convictions, sentencing dates) and include statute references. If guidelines calculations appear, extract offense level, criminal history category, and guideline range, along with any statutory maximum. Flag sentencing aggravators such as repeated reentries after removal, reentry after prior §1326 conviction, suspected gang membership, violence or intimidation while in custody, and disregard of removal orders.",
