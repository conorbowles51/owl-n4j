Focus on people (suspects, directors, beneficial owners), corporate structures (companies, shell companies, ownership chains), money flows (accounts, transactions, transfers), and communications (emails, calls, meetings). Use specific entity types that reflect the fraud context - prefer precise types like 'ShellCompany' or 'NomineeDirector' over generic ones. Capture dates for all events and amounts for financial transactions. Flag suspicious patterns: threshold structuring, layered transactions, obscured ownership, or timing anomalies.",
