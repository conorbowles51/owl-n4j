Step 1: Extract call metadata from .sri files (date/time of call, contact ID, input line ID, session length). Step 2: Transcribe audio files from Spanish to text, then translate the Spanish transcription to English. Step 3: Extract participant names and prosecutor interpretation text from .rtf files. Step 4: Combine all extracted information into a structured document where metadata, participants, Spanish transcription, English translation, and interpretation are clearly labeled. All participants, locations, times, phone numbers, and entities mentioned across any file are part of the same wiretap call and should be linked together. When the LLM processes this combined document, it should understand that all entities and relationships extracted relate to a single wiretap recording event. Ensure all metadataa is used. Create dates of the call which is in the .sri file, the agent's notes about the call in the rtf, and the phone id from and phone id to in the sri. This should be collated with all text from transcript and translation and saved in vector db like it's one document. Entities should be extracted as usual from this \"document\"",
