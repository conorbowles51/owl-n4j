Enhance cost ledger with comprehensive filtering and display improvements

Fixed critical bug preventing cost records from being saved during document
ingestion. SQLAlchemy was converting enum values to their names instead of
values, causing PostgreSQL enum validation errors.

Changes:
- Fixed cost tracking enum conversion: Updated cost_record.py to use
  postgresql.ENUM with explicit values and cost_tracking_service.py to use
  job_type.value, ensuring lowercase enum values are correctly passed to
  the database

- Added time period filtering: Implemented quick filters (Today, This Week,
  This Month) and custom date range filtering (start_date/end_date) for both
  the cost ledger records and summary endpoints

- Enhanced summary calculations: Updated summary endpoint to respect all
  filters (job_type, model_id, case_id, time_period, date range) so totals
  accurately reflect filtered data

- Added active filters display: Implemented visual filter indicator at the
  top of the cost ledger modal showing all active filters (job type, model,
  case, date range/period) for better user awareness

- Improved filter UX: Date range and quick time period filters are mutually
  exclusive, with date range taking precedence when both are set

This ensures cost records are properly saved during ingestion and provides
users with flexible, comprehensive filtering options to analyze OpenAI API
usage and costs.
