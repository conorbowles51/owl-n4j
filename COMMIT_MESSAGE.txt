Major Features:
- Graph expansion: Added ability to expand nodes by N hops in Query Focus Graph and Result Graph
  - Backend: Added expand_nodes() method to Neo4jService with configurable depth
  - Frontend: Added ExpandGraphModal for user input, expansion buttons, and context menu option
  - Supports expanding all nodes, selected nodes, or specific node sets

- Entity resolution and merging: Added comprehensive entity resolution system
  - Backend: Added find_similar_entities() and merge_entities() methods
  - Frontend: Added MergeEntitiesModal with side-by-side comparison and "Use Both" option
  - Find Similar Entities button in graph controls and Query Focus Graph menu
  - Merge selected entities from context menu
  - Supports merging properties from both entities with user control

- Node deletion: Added ability to delete nodes from graph
  - Backend: Added delete_node() method with relationship deletion
  - Frontend: Added Delete Node option in context menu with confirmation dialog
  - Automatic cleanup from selected nodes, subgraph, and timeline context

UI/UX Improvements:
- Fixed button spacing in graph controls (top-left floating buttons) with consistent 2px gaps
- Renamed "Subgraph" to "Query Focus Graph" throughout UI for clarity
- Added Result Graph tab toggle in subgraph panel
- Auto-open subgraph panel when AI assistant is opened

- Improved error handling for missing API keys and embedding dimension mismatches

Documentation:
- Added AI_ASSISTANT_PROMPT_EXPLANATION.md
- Added NEO4J_TRANSACTION_LOG_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Updated various configuration guides

Backend Changes:

- Improved logging for all graph operations
- Added defensive error handling throughout

Frontend Changes:
